# üìú Elemental Powers - Game Design Document

Powers are grouped into five elemental types‚ÄîFire, Water, Earth, Thunder, and Time‚Äîand each type has three upgrade levels. Higher levels grant more powerful effects but require more mana.

## Design Notes

* **Balance:** Time and Water offer strong utility for escaping checkmates. Fire and Thunder offer tactical resets. Earth is ideal for long-term planning.
* **Cost Scaling:** Higher-tier powers should cost more mana and/or have cooldowns.
* **Progression:** Unlock powers via XP. Mana limits usage per game.
* **Synergies:** Players can combo elemental effects for strategic depth (e.g. Earth-anchor a card, then Fire-burn others).
